GitHub Collaborator Recommendation System

This project builds a machine learning pipeline that analyzes GitHub repository metadata to recommend potential collaborators based on developer similarity. It is designed as a full end-to-end scikit-learn workflow.

The dataset consists of GitHub repositories along with information such as topics, textual descriptions, stars, and forks. These features are processed to create developer-level representations, which are then used to compute similarity and generate collaborator recommendations.
